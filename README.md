## 📦 Installation
Download the repository, run `npm install` to install dependencies, and build the project with `npm start`. Make sure you have npm and Node.js v10.0.0 or greater installed ([how?](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)). If you have any issues running the build script, you can perform all the steps in that script manually.

Next, the build directory or zip file can be loaded into your browser of choice: [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest) / [Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) / [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/part1-simple-extension#run-your-extension-locally-in-your-browser-while-developing-it-side-loading) / [Opera](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/testing/)


## 🕹️ Usage
Install the extension and click the browser action button while on one of the following domains to run the replacement script:
- http(s)://outlook.live.com/
- http(s)://outlook.office.com/
- http(s)://outlook.office365.com/
- http(s)://support.office.live.com/

Senders' names are replaced with random American names and attachments are hidden completely. Subjects, messages, and folders are replaced with random Lorem Ipsum text. See [Dark Mode for Outlook][dfmo_link] for example screenshots.
